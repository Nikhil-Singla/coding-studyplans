(Easy : Medium : Hard)

Journal Entry:
Its algorithm1, Day 7. Noticeable improvements in my time and code generation already. My thinking has become more intuitive due to my experience. Specially seen in
Max Area of Island (Usage of the Max function from one of the previous codes which I normally wouldn't have done before)
Just felt really happy and satisfied on this small achievement. I can feel the improvements in real time.

Day 9: Really put my foot in my mouth with that one. End of the Study Plan to focus more on my game creation in <Projects> Repository. Also depth first 
search was getting harder and harder to understand due to insufficient preperation hence I'm ending this study plan for now, perhaps will come back to 
it later when I understand more.
