# Tagging conventions for this repository

Using tags to mark status, difficulty, and topics for each problem. Tags should be in kebab-case.

Tags: array, hash-table, easy, solved

Core status tags
- [solved] Problem solved and verified to pass all testcases.  
- [first-attempt] First working attempt at the code. May or may not pass all the testcases  
- [main-topic]: Can range beyond array, two-pointers, binary-search, dp, graph, recursion, sliding-window, linked-list, tree  
- [in-progress]: May range from in-progress code to needing review or refactor
- [documentation]: Purely for documentation purposes. Need to visit commit history to look at older tags.

Recommended additional tags
- [assisted]: External solution was used (beyond code editor, may be documentation lookup or function definition)
- [difficulty]: Easy, medium, hard 

Normalization rules
- Use `kebab-case`. Convert spaces/underscores to hyphens and lowercase everything.  
- Separate multiple tags between square brackets.
- Additional tags can be as attributes or stand-alone.
