# LeetCode Study Plans

A collection of solutions from various LeetCode study plans, tracking progress through algorithms, data structures, and dynamic programming.

**Progress:** 50% complete  
**Status:** Currently inactive

## What's Here

This repo contains problem solutions from multiple study tracks:
- Algorithm fundamentals (binary search, two pointers, sliding window, DFS, recursion)
- Dynamic programming problems
- Big 75 LeetCode problems

## A Quick Note

The code here is built specifically to solve competition problems within their constraints. It's not production-grade, not meant to be exhaustive, and definitely not the only way to solve these problems. Think of it as a learning record; what worked, how I approached it, and what I learned along the way.
